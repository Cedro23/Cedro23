Hi ! I am Cédric LESUEUR, I am currently 24 years old, and I am living in France. I spent 13 years of my life in Italy, so I speak 3 languages.
I am a young back-end developper and have a master's degree in data science and data engineering.

I have always been found of logic and video games, hence my decision to study computer science and take a master in data science and data engineering.
I clearly am more a software developper than a data scientist/engineer, but I like to discover stuff and learn things !

I am also passionate about sports and chess, I am a newbie triathlete and I love cycling and swimming.

My goals in regard to developing would be to learn continue learning C# on a daily basis and maybe one day start making a chess engine.
