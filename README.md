Hi ! I am Cédric LESUEUR, I am currently 23 years old, and I am living in France (for now). I spent 13 years of my life in Italy, so I speak 3 languages.
I am a young back-end developper who will soon have finished his master degree in data science and data engineering.

I have always been found of logic and video games, hence my decision to study computer science and take a master in data science and data engineering.
I clearly am more a software developper than a data scientist/engineer, but I like to discover stuff and learn things !

I am also passionate about sports, I am a newbie triathlete and I love cycling and swimming.

I am currently (re)learning C++ to acquire knowledge and get better at what I love.
